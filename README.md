Learning to start the server with Node JS.

### Dependencies

The Frameworks used to help build the server were added as it follows:

```
Yarn add body-parser@1.19.0
Yarn add cors@2.8.5
Yarn add dotenv@8.2.0
Yarn add express@4.17.1
Yarn add mongoose@5.10.2
Yarn add morgan@1.10.0 -D 
Yarn add nodemon@2.0.4 -D
```

#### File basis

The new files created as basis for the project:

* .env

The server is seen in the link: http://Localhost:8001/api, with the command:

```
yarn start
```
